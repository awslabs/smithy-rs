When enabled, stalled-stream\nprotection will ensure that bad streams error out quickly, regardless of the amount of data being\ndownloaded.\n\nProtection is enabled by default for all clients but can be configured or disabled.\nSee [this discussion](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/discussions/956) for more details.\n",
