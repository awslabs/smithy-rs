/// It is designed to be nearly infinitely flexible, because `Output` is unconstrained, it can be used to support
/// event streams, S3 streaming responses, regular request-response style operations, as well
/// as any other HTTP-based protocol that we manage to come up with.
///
/// The split between `parse_unloaded` and `parse_loaded` enables keeping the parsing code pure and sync
/// whenever possible and delegating the process of actually reading the HTTP response to the caller when
/// the required behavior is simply "read to the end."
///
/// It also enables this critical and core trait to avoid being async, and it makes code that uses
/// the trait easier to test.

    /// `Result<ListTablesResponse, ListTablesError>`
