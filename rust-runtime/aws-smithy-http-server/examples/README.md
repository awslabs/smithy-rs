# Smithy Rust Server SDK example

This folder contains an example service called Pok√©mon Service used to showcase the service framework capabilities and to run benchmarks.

## Build

Since this example requires both the server and client SDK to be code-generated from their [model](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/tree/main/codegen-server-test/model/pokemon.smithy), a Makefile is provided to build and run the service. Just run `make` to prepare the first build.

Once the example has been built successfully the first time, idiomatic `cargo` can be used directly.

`make dist-clean` can be used for a complete cleanup of all artefacts.

## Run

TBD.

## Test

TBD.

## Benchmarks
