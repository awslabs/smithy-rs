## vNext (Month Day Year)

**Breaking changes**
* `test-util` has been made an optional dependency and has moved from
  aws-hyper to smithy-http. If you were relying on `aws_hyper::TestConnection`, add `smithy-client` as a dependency
  and enable the optional `test-util` feature. This prunes some unnecessary dependencies on `roxmltree` and `serde_json`
  for most users. (#608)

**New This Week**
- :bug: Bugfix: Fix parsing bug where whitespace was stripped when parsing XML (#590)
