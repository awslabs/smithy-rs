=======================

**New this release**
- Improve docs on `aws-smithy-client` (smithy-rs#855)

**Breaking Changes**
- (aws-smithy-client): Extraneous `pub use SdkSuccess` removed from `aws_smithy_client::hyper_ext`. (smithy-rs#855)

**New this week**

- Timeouts for requests are now configurable. You can set separate timeouts for each individual request attempt and all attempts made for a request. (smithy-rs#831)

v0.29.0-alpha (November 11th, 2021)
===================================

**Breaking Changes**

Several breaking changes around `aws_smithy_types::Instant` were introduced by smithy-rs#849:
- `aws_smithy_types::Instant` from was renamed to `DateTime` to avoid confusion with the standard library's monotonically non-decreasing `Instant` type.
- `DateParseError` in `aws_smithy_types` has been renamed to `DateTimeParseError` to match the type that's being parsed.
- The `chrono-conversions` feature and associated functions have been moved to the `aws-smithy-types-convert` crate.
  - Calls to `Instant::from_chrono` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    use aws_smithy_types::DateTime;
    use aws_smithy_types_convert::date_time::DateTimeExt;

    // For chrono::DateTime<Utc>
    let date_time = DateTime::from_chrono_utc(chrono_date_time);
    // For chrono::DateTime<FixedOffset>
    let date_time = DateTime::from_chrono_offset(chrono_date_time);
    ```
  - Calls to `instant.to_chrono()` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    use aws_smithy_types_convert::date_time::DateTimeExt;

    date_time.to_chrono_utc();
    ```
- `Instant::from_system_time` and `Instant::to_system_time` have been changed to `From` trait implementations.
  - Calls to `from_system_time` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    DateTime::from(system_time);
    // or
    let date_time: DateTime = system_time.into();
    ```
  - Calls to `to_system_time` should be changed to:
    ```rust
    SystemTime::from(date_time);
    // or
    let system_time: SystemTime = date_time.into();
    ```
- Several functions in `Instant`/`DateTime` were renamed:
  - `Instant::from_f64` -> `DateTime::from_secs_f64`
  - `Instant::from_fractional_seconds` -> `DateTime::from_fractional_secs`
  - `Instant::from_epoch_seconds` -> `DateTime::from_secs`
  - `Instant::from_epoch_millis` -> `DateTime::from_millis`
  - `Instant::epoch_fractional_seconds` -> `DateTime::as_secs_f64`
  - `Instant::has_nanos` -> `DateTime::has_subsec_nanos`
  - `Instant::epoch_seconds` -> `DateTime::secs`
  - `Instant::epoch_subsecond_nanos` -> `DateTime::subsec_nanos`
  - `Instant::to_epoch_millis` -> `DateTime::to_millis`
- The `DateTime::fmt` method is now fallible and fails when a `DateTime`'s value is outside what can be represented by the desired date format.
- In `aws-sigv4`, the `SigningParams` builder's `date_time` setter was renamed to `time` and changed to take a `std::time::SystemTime` instead of a chrono's `DateTime<Utc>`.

**New this week**

- :warning: MSRV increased from 1.53.0 to 1.54.0 per our 3-behind MSRV policy.
- Conversions from `aws_smithy_types::DateTime` to `OffsetDateTime` from the `time` crate are now available from the `aws-smithy-types-convert` crate. (smithy-rs#849)
- Fixed links to Usage Examples (smithy-rs#862, @floric)

v0.28.0-alpha (November 11th, 2021)
===================================

No changes since last release except for version bumping since older versions
of the AWS SDK were failing to compile with the `0.27.0-alpha.2` version chosen
for the previous release.

v0.27.0-alpha.2 (November 9th, 2021)
=======================
**Breaking Changes**

- Members named `builder` on model structs were renamed to `builder_value` so that their accessors don't conflict with the existing `builder()` methods (smithy-rs#842)

**New this week**

- Fix epoch seconds date-time parsing bug in `aws-smithy-types` (smithy-rs#834)
- Omit trailing zeros from fraction when formatting HTTP dates in `aws-smithy-types` (smithy-rs#834)
- Generated structs now have accessor methods for their members (smithy-rs#842)

v0.27.0-alpha.1 (November 3rd, 2021)
====================================
**Breaking Changes**
- `<operation>.make_operation(&config)` is now an `async` function for all operations. Code should be updated to call `.await`. This will only impact users using the low-level API. (smithy-rs#797)

**New this week**
- SDK code generation now includes a version in addition to path parameters when the `version` parameter is included in smithy-build.json
- `moduleDescription` in `smithy-build.json` settings is now optional
- Upgrade to Smithy 1.12
- `hyper::Error(IncompleteMessage)` will now be retried (smithy-rs#815)
- Unions will optionally generate an `Unknown` variant to support parsing variants that don't exist on the client. These variants will fail to serialize if they are ever included in requests.
- Fix generated docs on unions. (smithy-rs#826)

v0.27 (October 20th, 2021)
==========================

**Breaking Changes**

- :warning: All Smithy runtime crates have been renamed to have an `aws-` prefix. This may require code changes:
  - _Cargo.toml_ changes:
    - `smithy-async` -> `aws-smithy-async`
    - `smithy-client` -> `aws-smithy-client`
    - `smithy-eventstream` -> `aws-smithy-eventstream`
    - `smithy-http` -> `aws-smithy-http`
    - `smithy-http-tower` -> `aws-smithy-http-tower`
    - `smithy-json` -> `aws-smithy-json`

    - `smithy-types` -> `aws-smithy-types`
    - `smithy-xml` -> `aws-smithy-xml`
  - Rust `use` statement changes:
    - `smithy_async` -> `aws_smithy_async`
    - `smithy_client` -> `aws_smithy_client`
    - `smithy_eventstream` -> `aws_smithy_eventstream`
    - `smithy_http` -> `aws_smithy_http`
    - `smithy_http_tower` -> `aws_smithy_http_tower`
    - `smithy_json` -> `aws_smithy_json`
    - `smithy_protocol_test` -> `aws_smithy_protocol_test`
    - `smithy_query` -> `aws_smithy_query`
    - `smithy_types` -> `aws_smithy_types`
    - `smithy_xml` -> `aws_smithy_xml`

**New this week**

- Filled in missing docs for services in the rustdoc documentation (smithy-rs#779)

v0.26 (October 15th, 2021)
=======================

**Breaking Changes**

- :warning: The `rust-codegen` plugin now requires a `moduleDescription` in the *smithy-build.json* file. This
  property goes into the generated *Cargo.toml* file as the package description. (smithy-rs#766)

**New this week**

- Add `RustSettings` to `CodegenContext` (smithy-rs#616, smithy-rs#752)
- Prepare crate manifests for publishing to crates.io (smithy-rs#755)
- Generated *Cargo.toml* files can now be customized (smithy-rs#766)

v0.25.1 (October 11th, 2021)
=========================
**New this week**
- :bug: Re-add missing deserialization operations that were missing because of a typo in `HttpBoundProtocolGenerator.kt`

v0.25 (October 7th, 2021)
=========================
**Breaking changes**
- :warning: MSRV increased from 1.52.1 to 1.53.0 per our 3-behind MSRV policy.
- :warning: `smithy_client::retry::Config` field `max_retries` is renamed to `max_attempts`
  - This also brings a change to the semantics of the field. In the old version, setting `max_retries` to 3 would mean
    that up to 4 requests could occur (1 initial request and 3 retries). In the new version, setting `max_attempts` to 3
    would mean that up to 3 requests could occur (1 initial request and 2 retries).
- :warning: `smithy_client::retry::Config::with_max_retries` method is renamed to `with_max_attempts`
- :warning: Several classes in the codegen module were renamed and/or refactored (smithy-rs#735):
  - `ProtocolConfig` became `CodegenContext` and moved to `software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy`
  - `HttpProtocolGenerator` became `ProtocolGenerator` and was refactored
    to rely on composition instead of inheritance
  - `HttpProtocolTestGenerator` became `ProtocolTestGenerator`
  - `Protocol` moved into `software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy.protocols`
- `SmithyConnector` and `DynConnector` now return `ConnectorError` instead of `Box<dyn Error>`. If you have written a custom connector, it will need to be updated to return the new error type. (#744)
- The `DispatchError` variant of `SdkError` now contains `ConnectorError` instead of `Box<dyn Error>` (#744).

**New this week**

- :bug: Fix an issue where `smithy-xml` may have generated invalid XML (smithy-rs#719)
- Add `RetryConfig` struct for configuring retry behavior (smithy-rs#725)
- :bug: Fix error when receiving empty event stream messages (smithy-rs#736)
- :bug: Fix bug in event stream receiver that could cause the last events in the response stream to be lost (smithy-rs#736)
- Add connect & HTTP read timeouts to IMDS, defaulting to 1 second
- IO and timeout errors from Hyper can now be retried (#744)

- :bug: Fixes naming collision during generation of model shapes that collide with `<operationname>Input` and `<operationname>Output` (#699)

v0.22 (September 2nd, 2021)
===========================

This release adds support for three commonly requested features:
- More powerful credential chain
- Support for constructing multiple clients from the same configuration
- Support for Transcribe streaming and S3 Select

In addition, this overhauls client configuration which lead to a number of breaking changes. Detailed changes are inline.

Current Credential Provider Support:
- [x] Environment variables
- [x] Web Identity Token Credentials
- [ ] Profile file support (partial)
  - [ ] Credentials
    - [ ] SSO
    - [ ] ECS Credential source
    - [ ] IMDS credential source
    - [x] Assume role from source profile
    - [x] Static credentials source profile
    - [x] WebTokenIdentity provider
  - [x] Region
- [ ] IMDS
- [ ] ECS

Upgrade Guide
-------------

### If you use `<sdk>::Client::from_env`

`from_env` loaded region & credentials from environment variables _only_. Default sources have been removed from the generated
SDK clients and moved to the `aws-config` package. Note that the `aws-config` package default chain adds support for
profile file and web identity token profiles.

1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
2. Update your client creation code:
   ```rust
   // `shared_config` can be used to construct multiple different service clients!
   let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
   // before: <service>::Client::from_env();
   let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config)
   ```

### If you used `<client>::Config::builder()`

`Config::build()` has been modified to _not_ fallback to a default provider. Instead, use `aws-config` to load and modify
the default chain. Note that when you switch to `aws-config`, support for profile files and web identity tokens will be added.

1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```

2. Update your client creation code:

   ```rust
   fn before() {
     let region = aws_types::region::ChainProvider::first_try(<1 provider>).or_default_provider();
     let config = <service>::Config::builder().region(region).build();
     let client = <service>::Client::from_conf(&config);
   }

   async fn after() {
     use aws_config::meta::region::RegionProviderChain;
     let region_provider = RegionProviderChain::first_try(<1 provider>).or_default_provider();
     // `shared_config` can be used to construct multiple different service clients!
     let shared_config = aws_config::from_env().region(region_provider).load().await;
     let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config)
   }
   ```

### If you used `aws-auth-providers`
All credential providers that were in `aws-auth-providers` have been moved to `aws-config`. Unless you have a specific use case
for a specific credential provider, you should use the default provider chain:

```rust
 let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
 let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config);
```

### If you maintain your own credential provider

`AsyncProvideCredentials` has been renamed to `ProvideCredentials`. The trait has been moved from `aws-auth` to `aws-types`.
The original `ProvideCredentials` trait has been removed. The return type has been changed to by a custom future.

For synchronous use cases:
```rust
use aws_types::credentials::{ProvideCredentials, future};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomCreds;
impl ProvideCredentials for CustomCreds {
  fn provide_credentials<'a>(&'a self) -> future::ProvideCredentials<'a>
    where
            Self: 'a,
  {
    // if your credentials are synchronous, use `::ready`
    // if your credentials are loaded asynchronously, use `::new`
    future::ProvideCredentials::ready(todo!()) // your credentials go here
  }
}
```

For asynchronous use cases:
```rust
use aws_types::credentials::{ProvideCredentials, future, Result};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomAsyncCreds;
impl CustomAsyncCreds {
  async fn load_credentials(&self) -> Result {
    Ok(Credentials::from_keys("my creds...", "secret", None))
  }
}

impl ProvideCredentials for CustomCreds {
  fn provide_credentials<'a>(&'a self) -> future::ProvideCredentials<'a>
    where
            Self: 'a,
  {
    future::ProvideCredentials::new(self.load_credentials())
  }
}
```

Changes
-------

**Breaking Changes**

- Credential providers from `aws-auth-providers` have been moved to `aws-config` (#678)
- `AsyncProvideCredentials` has been renamed to `ProvideCredentials`. The original non-async provide credentials has been
  removed. See the migration guide above.
- `<sevicename>::from_env()` has been removed (#675). A drop-in replacement is available:
  1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
  2. Update your client creation code:
     ```rust
     let client = <service>>::Client::new(&aws_config::load_from_env().await)
     ```

- `ProvideRegion` has been moved to `aws_config::meta::region::ProvideRegion`. (#675)
- `aws_types::region::ChainProvider` has been moved to `aws_config::meta::region::RegionProviderChain` (#675).
- `ProvideRegion` is now asynchronous. Code that called `provider.region()` must be changed to `provider.region().await`.
- `<awsservice>::Config::builder()` will **not** load a default region. To preserve previous behavior:
  1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
  2. ```rust
     let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
     let config = <service>::config::Builder::from(&shared_config).<other builder modifications>.build();
     ```
- `Request` and `Response` in `smithy_http::operation` now use `SharedPropertyBag` instead of `Arc<Mutex<PropertyBag>>`. Use the `acquire` and `acquire_mut` methods to get a reference to the underlying `PropertyBag` to access properties. (#667)

**New this week**

- :tada: Add profile file provider for region (#594, #682)
- :tada: Add support for shared configuration between multiple services (#673)
- :tada: Add support for Transcribe `StartStreamTranscription` and S3 `SelectObjectContent` operations (#667)

- Add NowOrLater future to smithy-async (#672)


v0.21 (August 19th, 2021)
=========================

**New This Week**

- :tada: Add Chime Identity, Chime Messaging, and Snow Device Management support (#657)
- :tada: Add profile file credential provider implementation. This implementation currently does not support credential sources for assume role providers other than environment variables. (#640)
- :tada: Add support for WebIdentityToken providers via profile & environment variables. (#654)
- :bug: Fix name collision that occurred when a model had both a union and a structure named `Result` (#643)
- :bug: Fix STS Assume Role with WebIdentity & Assume role with SAML to support clients with no credentials provided (#652)
- Update AWS SDK models (#657)
- Add initial implementation of a default provider chain. (#650)

**Internal Changes**

- Update sigv4 tests to work around behavior change in httparse 1.5. (#656)
- Remove Bintray/JCenter source from gradle build. (#651)
- Add experimental `dvr` module to smithy-client. This will enable easier testing of HTTP traffic. (#640)
- Update smithy-client to simplify creating HTTP/HTTPS connectors (#650)
- Add Event Stream support to aws-sigv4 (#648)
- Add support for the smithy auth trait. This enables authorizations that explicitly disable authorization to work when no credentials have been provided. (#652)

v0.20 (August 10th, 2021)
=========================

**Breaking changes**

- (#635) The `config()`, `config_mut()`, `request()`, and `request_mut()` methods on `operation::Request` have been
  renamed to `properties()`, `properties_mut()`, `http()`, and `http_mut()` respectively.
- (#635) The `Response` type on Tower middleware has been changed from `http::Response<SdkBody>`
  to `operation::Response`. The HTTP response is still available from the `operation::Response` using its `http()`
  and `http_mut()` methods.
- (#635) The `ParseHttpResponse` trait's `parse_unloaded()` method now takes an `operation::Response` rather than
  an `http::Response<SdkBody>`.
- (#626) `ParseHttpResponse` no longer has a generic argument for the body type, but instead, always uses `SdkBody`.
  This may cause compilation failures for you if you are using Smithy generated types to parse JSON or XML without using
  a client to request data from a service. The fix should be as simple as removing `<SdkBody>` in the example below:

  Before:
  ```rust
  let output = <Query as ParseHttpResponse<SdkBody>>::parse_loaded(&parser, &response).unwrap();
  ```

  After:
  ```rust
  let output = <Query as ParseHttpResponse>::parse_loaded(&parser, &response).unwrap();
  ```

**New This Week**

- Add AssumeRoleProvider parser implementation. (#632)
- The closure passed to `provide_credentials_fn` can now borrow values (#637)
- Add `Sender`/`Receiver` implementations for Event Stream (#639)
- Bring in the latest AWS models (#630)

========================

IoT Data Plane is now available! If you discover it isn't functioning as expected, please let us know!

This week also sees the addition of a robust async caching credentials provider. Take a look at the
[STS example](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/blob/7fa4af4a9367aeca6d55e26fc4d4ba93093b90c4/aws/sdk/examples/sts/src/bin/credentials-provider.rs)
to see how to use it.

========================

- Remove timestreamwrite and timestreamquery from the generated services (#613)

v0.18 (July 27th 2021)
======================

**Breaking changes**

- `test-util` has been made an optional dependency and has moved from aws-hyper to smithy-http. If you were relying
  on `aws_hyper::TestConnection`, add `smithy-client` as a dependency and enable the optional `test-util` feature. This
  prunes some unnecessary dependencies on `roxmltree` and `serde_json`
  for most users. (#608)

**New This Week**

- :tada: Release all but three remaining AWS services! Glacier, IoT Data Plane and Transcribe streaming will be
  available in a future release. If you discover that a service isn't functioning as expected please let us know! (#607)
