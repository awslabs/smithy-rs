All relevant types from [aws-smithy-http-server](https://docs.rs/aws-smithy-http-server/0.63.3/aws_smithy_http_server/) are now re-exported within the generated crates. This removes the need to explicitly depend on [aws-smithy-http-server](https://docs.rs/aws-smithy-http-server/0.63.3/aws_smithy_http_server/) in service handler code and prevents compilation errors caused by version mismatches.
