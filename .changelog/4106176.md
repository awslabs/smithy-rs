The generated crates no longer have the `aws-lambda` feature flag enabled by default. This prevents the [aws-lambda](https://docs.rs/crate/aws-smithy-http-server/0.63.3/features#aws-lambda) feature from being automatically enabled in [aws-smithy-http-server](https://docs.rs/aws-smithy-http-server/0.63.3/aws_smithy_http_server/) when the SDK is not intended for AWS Lambda.
