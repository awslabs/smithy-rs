Fix the execution order of [modify_before_serialization](https://docs.rs/aws-smithy-runtime-api/latest/aws_smithy_runtime_api/client/interceptors/trait.Intercept.html#method.modify_before_serialization) and [read_before_serialization](https://docs.rs/aws-smithy-runtime-api/latest/aws_smithy_runtime_api/client/interceptors/trait.Intercept.html#method.read_before_serialization) in the orchestrator. The `modify_before_serialization` method now executes before the `read_before_serialization` method. This adjustment may result in changes in behavior depending on how you customize interceptors.
