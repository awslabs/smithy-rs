`aws-config` will now work as intended for users that want to use `native-tls` instead of `rustls`. Previously, it was
difficult to ensure that `rustls` was not in use. Also, there is now an example of how to use `native-tls` and a test
that ensures `rustls` is not in the dependency tree

message = '''
If you directly depend on AWS or Smithy runtime crates _(e.g., AWS crates not named `aws-config` or prefixed with `aws-sdk-`)_,
the formerly default features from those crates must now be explicitly set in your `Cargo.toml`.
