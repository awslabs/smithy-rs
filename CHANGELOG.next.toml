message = "Clients now enforce that the Content-Length sent by the server matches the length of the returned response body. In most cases, Hyper will enforce this behavior, however, in extremely rare circumstances where the Tokio runtime is dropped in between subsequent requests, this scenario can occur."

message = "Stalled stream protection for download streams no longer triggers when user-code is taking a significant amount of time doing something other than downloading in the middle of the stream. As an example, previously, making a HTTP request to another service for each row in CSV file download from S3 would result in a stalled stream timeout."
