message = """
The SDK, by default, now times out if socket connect or time to first byte read takes longer than
3.1 seconds. There are a large number of breaking changes that come with this change that may
affect you if you customize the client configuration at all.
See [the upgrade guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/622) for information
on how to configure timeouts, and how to resolve compilation issues after upgrading.

message = """
Setting connect/read timeouts with `SdkConfig` now works. Previously, these timeout config values
were lost during connector creation, so the only reliable way to set them was to manually override
the HTTP connector.

A large list of breaking changes were made to accomodate default timeouts in the AWS SDK.
