message = """
Add configurable stalled-stream protection for downloads.

When making HTTP calls,
it's possible for a connection to 'stall out' and emit no more data due to server-side issues.
In the event this happens, it's desirable for the stream to error out as quickly as possible.
While timeouts can protect you from this issue, they aren't adaptive to the amount of data
being sent and so must be configured specifically for each use case. When enabled, stalled-stream
protection will ensure that bad streams error out quickly, regardless of the amount of data being
downloaded.

Protection is enabled by default for all clients but can be configured or disabled.
See [this discussion](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/discussions/956) for more details.
