[[aws-sdk-rust]]
message = """
`aws_types::config::Config` has been renamed to `aws_types::sdk_config::SdkConfig`. This is to better differentiate it
from service-specific configs like `aws_sdk_s3::Config`. If you were creating shared configs with
`aws_config::load_from_env()`, then you don't have to do anything. If you were directly referring to a shared config,
update your `use` statements and `struct` names.

_Before:_
```rust
use aws_types::config::Config;

fn main() {
    let config = Config::builder()
    // config builder methods...
    .build()
    .await;
}
```

_After:_
```rust
// We re-export this type from the root module so it's easier to reference
use aws_types::SdkConfig;

fn main() {
    let config = SdkConfig::builder()
    // config builder methods...
    .build()
    .await;
}
```
