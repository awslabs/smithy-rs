`Message`, `Header`, `HeaderValue`, and `StrBytes` have been moved to `aws-smithy-types` from `aws-smithy-eventstream`. `Message::read_from` and `Message::write_to` remain in `aws-smithy-eventstream` but they are converted to free functions with the names `read_message_from` and `write_message_to` respectively.

An operation output that supports receiving events from stream now provides a new-type wrapping `aws_smithy_http::event_stream::receiver::Receiver`.
