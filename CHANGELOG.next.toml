Fix compilation of `aws-config` with `rustls` and `native-tls` disabled. The
`ProviderConfig::with_tcp_connector` method uses
`aws_smithy_client::hyper_ext`, which only exists with the `client-hyper`
feature enabled. Add a feature enabling that, and enable it by default.

Updated the smithy client's retry behavior to allow for a configurable initial backoff. Previously, the initial backoff
(named `r` in the code) was set to 2 seconds. This is not an ideal default for services that expect clients to quickly
retry failed request attempts. Now, users can set quicker (or slower) backoffs according to their needs.

message = """
Until now, SDK crates have all shared the exact same version numbers.
This changes with this release. From now on, SDK crates will only version
bump if they have changes. Coincidentally, they may share the same version
number for some releases since changes to the code generator will cause
a version bump in all of them, but this should not be relied upon.
