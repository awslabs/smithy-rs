<details>
<summary>Breaking change in how event stream signing works (click to expand more details)</summary>

This change will only impact you if you are wiring up their own event stream signing/authentication scheme. If you're using `aws-sig-auth` to use AWS SigV4 event stream signing, then this change will **not** impact you.

Previously, event stream signing was configured at codegen time by placing a `new_event_stream_signer` method on the `Config`. This function was called at serialization time to connect the signer to the streaming body. Now, instead, a special `DeferredSigner` is wired up at serialization time that relies on a signing implementation to be sent on a channel by the HTTP request signer. To do this, a `DeferredSignerSender` must be pulled out of the property bag, and its `send()` method called with the desired event stream signing implementation.

See the changes in https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/pull/2671 for an example of how this was done for SigV4.
