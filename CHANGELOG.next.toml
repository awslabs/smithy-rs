Fix compilation of `aws-config` with `rustls` and `native-tls` disabled. The
`ProviderConfig::with_tcp_connector` method uses
`aws_smithy_client::hyper_ext`, which only exists with the `client-hyper`
feature enabled. Add a feature enabling that, and enable it by default.

message = """
Updated the smithy client's retry behavior to allow for a configurable initial backoff. Previously, the initial backoff
(named `r` in the code) was set to 2 seconds. This is not an ideal default for services that expect clients to quickly
retry failed request attempts. Now, users can set quicker (or slower) backoffs according to their needs.

Updated SDK Client retry behavior to allow for a configurable initial backoff. Previously, the initial backoff

clients to quickly retry failed request attempts. Now, users can set quicker (or slower) backoffs according to their
needs.
