message = "`aws_smithy_types::retry::RetryKind` had its `NotRetryable` variant split into `UnretryableFailure` and `Unnecessary`. If you implement the `ClassifyResponse`, then successful responses need to return `Unnecessary`, and failures that shouldn't be retried need to return `UnretryableFailure`."
